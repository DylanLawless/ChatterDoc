## You AIn’t Using It Right: AI Progress in Allergy

This repository contains the code, data, and documents associated with our response to Dages et al.'s letter on AI limitations in allergy, as featured in our publication: "You AIn’t using it right: Artificial intelligence progress in allergy." Our work demonstrates the application of AI, specifically ChatGPT, to enhance medical research in allergies by automating the extraction and analysis of PubMed sources.



## Getting Started

To replicate our analysis or explore the data and findings:

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine using Git.
2. **Navigate to the `src` directory** to find the R script (`jaci_gpt.R`) used for querying PubMed, analyzing abstracts, and generating summaries.
3. **Replace your terms** Example: `terms <- c("cefazolin", "penicillin", "allergy")`
3. **Data and Figures**: The `data` folder contains all the extracted data (`text_output`) and generated figures. Explore these to understand the analysis basis.
4. **Documentations and Paper**: Access the initial submission (`JACI-S-23-01178.pdf`), our reply to Dages et al. (`2023_Lawless_jaci_Reply_to_Dages_et_al-You_AIn’t_using_it_right-artificial_intelligence_progress_in_allergy.pdf`), and preprint materials in the `jaci_gpt_preprint_version` folder.

## Requirements

- R programming environment
- Required R packages as specified in the `jaci_gpt.R` script comments

## Usage

Follow the instructions within the `jaci_gpt.R` script to set up your environment, install necessary packages, and run the analyses.
